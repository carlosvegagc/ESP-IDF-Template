# Generic Template
Basic template to show the communication between 2 differentes tasks by the Queues.

## Keep attention to
- The includes. The queques functions are not completly build in the FreeRTOS include of ESP-IDF.
- The code organization. Dividing between multiple files is basic for advance projects.
- File CMakeLists.txt: It has the files in the project and if you create a new one you must included there.
